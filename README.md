# H2Lib

H2Lib is a software library for hierarchical matrices and H2-matrices
developed mainly by the
[Scientific Computing Group](https://www.math.uni-kiel.de/scicom)
of [Kiel University](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en).

The library offers

* functions for setting up cluster trees and block trees,

* functions for converting dense matrices and partially compressed
  matrices into hierarchical and H2-matrices,

* functions for creating hierarchical matrices and H2-matrices for
  boundary element methods using various compression techniques like
  Chebyshev interpolation, ACA, HCA, and Green quadrature,

* functions for creating hierarchical matrices and H2-matrices for
  finite element methods,

* functions for performing arithmetic operations on hierarchical
  matrices like truncated matrix multiplication, inversion,
  and factorization.
