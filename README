Welcome to H2Lib.

To get started, you just need

  * a C build environment (compiler, linker, libraries) and
  * a version of the "make" tool.

We recommend that you also obtain optimized implementations of
BLAS and LAPACK, since these improve the performance of H2Lib
significantly.

The build process is controlled by the files "system.inc" and
"options.inc".
The first file describes the properties of your system, e.g.,
which compiler to use and where certain libraries can be found.
The second file describes build options, e.g., whether you want
to use real or complex numbers.
The repository includes examples of both files for standard Linux
systems.

Once the configuration files are prepared, just enter

  make

to build the library in "Library" and the test programs in
"Tests".

If you have Doxygen installed, you can use

  make doc

to create the documentation of the library.

If you have questions, please feel free to contact the authors.
Most header files give the name of the author in charge, and you
can find the corresponding e-mail address in the file "AUTHORS".

Enjoy.
