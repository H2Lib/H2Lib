Welcome to H2Lib.

To get started, you just need

  * a C build environment (compiler, linker, libraries) and
  * a version of the "make" tool.

We recommend that you also obtain optimized implementations of
BLAS and LAPACK, since these improve the performance of H2Lib
significantly.

To set up H2Lib, you have to create a "make.inc" file setting
the parameters for the build process. Usually you will be able
to simply copy one of the files "make.inc.*" contained in the
repository, e.g., "make.inc.unix_opt".

Once "make.inc" is complete, just enter

  make

to build the library in "Library" and the test programs in
"Tests".

If you have Doxygen installed, you can use

  make doc

to create the documentation of the library.

If you have questions, please feel free to contact the authors.
Most header files give the name of the author in charge, and you
can find the corresponding e-mail address in the file "AUTHORS".

Enjoy.
